In this version I am going to add the core of constructions, until this version, constructions were just empty
shells with names, only use of which was to be an influencer for other actions.

I see constructions, not as new locations added to the location list, as it destroyes the undermining the whole
foundation of this game. Level is a template, which gives the information to Stage, meaning that if Level doesn't
include constructions as locations, constructions cannot be locaitons

This doesn't mean that they can't have similar functionality. In future constructions will have different features
and purposes, eg. raft will need supplies packed to escape or shelter will warm the player and serve as a storage.

However for now, that functionality isn't going to be included

To build a construction, player needs a certain amount of common and uncommon resources, in future with addition of
craft, the resources will need to split with thought

In future constructions can be built of different qualities, depending on the amount of resources spent and player
will be even able to upgrade them. However for now, I will stay with one type of construction, standard

When the construction is built, player will cause an action to appear, enter {construction}, after pressing this
action, the stage's construction which was entered will have entered: true, which will be a dependecy for actions
inside the construction

the argument is, whether have actions be in the main pull , or have constructions have their own actions
    1) give construction a list of action names, using which level is going to add those actions into delayedActions,
    which are going to be activated by enter {construction}, which itself is going to be activated by, build shelter
    2) give constructions a pre prepared list of actions, which will be shown to user when they enter construction
    (this may require some machinations in Game.tsx, which I don't really want to touch as much)
