Add Actions to constructions

Concept 1:
    - constructions will have a list of actions
    - actions inside constrution will be used as a pull of actions
     when enterin construction
    - when the checker for enter construction is returned as true,
    all the current actions are put into the waiting list and
    the actions inside location become initial actions



    Destructuring:

    For part 1:
        -create a list of actions in constructions
        
    For part 2 and 3:
        - adapt the method by which initial actions are chosen, so that,
        everything could go into a waiting list when needed and be chosen
        from another pull
