Add Actions to constructions

Concept 1:
    - constructions will have a list of actions
    - actions inside constrution will be used as a pull of actions
     when entering construction
    - when the checker for enter construction is returned as true,
    all the current actions are put into the waiting list and
    the actions inside location become initial actions

Concept 2 (final): 
    - constructions will have a list of actions
    - actions inside constrution will be used as a pull of actions
     when entering construction
    - when a apecific action is ran, eg. enterShelter. It switches
    action layer to switch between pull of actions


    Destructuring:

    For part 1:
        - create a list of actions in constructions
        
    For part 2 and 3:
        - create actionLayers in stage and add a methdos to switch
        between them in Game.tsx
