when a construction is built, its name is added to the actionLayerList

Stage will have actionLayers object with actionLayerList and 
currentActionLayer, which will be used to set current action layer

game.tsx is going to use currentActionLayer to show the actions

    game.tsx uses locations to show the actions, meaning that the change
    of location can only occure in the main layer

    some actions will change current action layer

    when current action layer is set, it will cause a checker which will
    try to find a construction with that name


Done: 

    + add actionLayers to Stage
    + add layer when new construction is built
    + create actions enterShelter
    + make a switch between actions depending on the currentActionLayer
    - make universal enterConstruction action
