Level and Stage may seem similar, i like to look at them as brothers, because they have the roles of controling the entire runtime

Level is static, meaning that it doesn't change (at least for now), and if will be changed will be changed rarely. Level defines
the parameters of the whole game

Stage is dynamic, it changes with every player action, or event. It uses Level as a reference and usees the values of the as readonly.
Stage instance is created initially with useEffect , which depends on level and loading. After that stage is recreated with slight changes
after every action
