There is a board/grid, representing an area, the user doesn't see the board, however each decision is a movement
on the board, which triggers different code, allows reusability and makes code more modular

every location has its key and a reference to other locations, the player can't go back, therefore if player went to
a new location, they do not have access to the previous location, usually 

the player is an object and the actions reference the geographical factors along with player items and stats to create
risks and calculate injuries

eg.

    player {
        str: 20,
        agil: 30,
        items: '...',
        injuries: '...
    }
    .geography {
        climate: 'humid',
        landscape: 'rocky',
        weather: 'morning'
    }

    climateStats {
        humid {
            enhancers: [[rocky, 1.50], [morning, 1.30]]
        }
        
    }

    riskCalc () {
        risk = if enhcars risk * enhancers - (players stats * debuffs)

        if risk > required, injury
    }
