Expected functionality:

    + all locations have common and uncommon items
    - constructions become locations, or rather player can enter constructions
    - add action significance, if action is significant enough, it can move the tiem of
        the day
    - add time to stage, some actions can be done only during certain times of the day
    + player added
    + player can collect items to build constructions
    + player has health and hunger
        i) eg. with hunger > 50%, player regenerates 10% health each day
    - player can sleep in shelter to skip the night
    - action to open player backpack to see items
    - some actions can be played a limited times in one day
    - a new type of actions or effect, which ocasionaly happen in between some of the
        other actions
        i) may reduce haelth
    - to build constructions player should have items

    
significant points:
    + 1) add player
    2) add time cycle
    3) effects/ passive actions
    4) constructions as locations
    5) rework action creation?
        - create some more action classes? so that some have must props
        - group some of the propsrties?
