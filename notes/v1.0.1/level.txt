Level is generated in the startGame functions, which is called in the beggining of the game.

Level , is an object which had all the possible actions, locations, constructions, items
and others for the map chosen (for no is only 'desserted island')

Level is used by stage to get its values

Level is not meant to update thoughout the game

How is Level created:

1. Level.generate() is called and set with setLevel()

2. in the static generate method

    - level gets allLocations, using the LocatinCollection.generate()
        method, which takes in map: GameMap as prop

    - constructions are got from the getConstructions function

    - graph for all locations is created, using generateGraph function, this graph is the
        representation of the 'paper map' for the chose map. Stage uses it, to move to
        different locations

    - the list of tags is created from the locations

    - allActions are chosen, depending on the tags list

    - level is created with the props above and returned, therefore set wiht setLevel()
