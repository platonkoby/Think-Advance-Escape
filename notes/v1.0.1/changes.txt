    Mechanics

        - MAJOR changes to action
            1) runUtils now also runs functionality which checks if delayed actions need to become 'current' actions
                and be availbale for the locaitons to take and later be displayed to the user
            2) there are now 2 types of actions, delayed and nondelayed

        - MAJOR changes to level
            1) the level object now has a single object with allLocations which has all the nonFixed, WC, inital and all locations
            2) constructions are added to level
            3) list of all tags is added to level
            4) level now acts as the representation of the game, which stores all the possible actions/locations/constructions for the chosen 
                gameMap

        - MAJOR changes to loctions
            1) Locations do not assign the actions to them before being exported, actions are now assinged in Stage
            2) LocationsCollection class is created, which creates a collection of locations depending on the map

        - MAJOR changes to stage
            1) stage now has the list of allActions, allLocations and a depencyMap for them
            2) the actions are assigned to locations in stage now
            3) actions are now split to initialActions and delayedActions, first being the actions which are currently displayed to user and
                second are monitoring the initial actions and are becoming a part of the first group if certain condition is met
        
        - minor changes to utils
            1) a function which returns a string with the items which could be found in the locaiton is returned, used to display the action
                on a button
