Stage, contains the game data and is updated with every action run

Stage is created based on the Level, it only contains values, which can be taken from the Level

How stage is created and updated

1. Initialy stage is created when the level is creted. There Stage.generate() is used
    to create stage. The values passed in this function: 

    - currentLocation - is an initial location, which comes from the location graph in Level
    - allActions - the list of actions, which is got from the Level
    - allLocations.all - the list of locations whic his got from the Level
    

2. With those initial values in Stage.generate():

    - Dependency map is built based on the set of provocativeActions. This set is got
        from all delayedActions.waitFor

        i. from there, a new map is built with keys being the titles of 
            provocativeActions and keys - dependentActions

    - new stage is created with passed in props, which are recieved from level and a newly
        created dependency map. Stage is not yet returned, therfore currentStage is not 
        yet set.

    - After stage is createdm Locations still don't have any assigned actions, therefore
        Stage,locationGetAction() is called

        i. in locationGetAction, locations get actions from the initial Action pull, depending
            on location's tags and types.

    - Stage is returned and set as currentStage

3. When the user click on the button, which calls the action, before the action is 
    actually called:

    - the button's action is updated with action.runUtils().

        i. there the acton's repeats are decreased by 1.

        ii. Also from there the stage.updateAllActions() is called. It is called here,
            because the allActions depend on the action which is being called

4. After the action updates, action is ran:

    - the action() is being playedm which created changes to the current stage,
        (changes like: currentlLocation or constructions)

    - Updated are the pushed to the stage.move(), which generates a new stage using
        the old stage and the updates
