LocationsCollection, is used to create a collections of locations for a chosen map

class LocationsCollection

    properties:
        -all: AllLoc[]
        -initialLocation?: LocInit
        -winConditionLocations?: LocWC[]
        -nonFixedLocations?: (LocSmall | LocLarge | LocMedium)[]

    methods:
        -setInitialLocations(locations: AllLoc[] = this.all)
        -setWCLocations(locations: AllLoc[] = this.all)
        -setNonFixedLocations(locations: AllLoc[] = this.all)
    
    static:
        -setMapLocations(map: GameMap, all: AllLocations['all'])
        -utilityLocationsSearch(fixed: boolean, type: LocationType, locations: AllLoc[])
        -generate(map: GameMap, all: AllLocations['all'] = locations)


- all, is a list of actions, which is later used to create 3 other properties of this object and all is later
changed to become a list of locatins which are only available for a certain map

- setInitialLocation, is a initial location for the chosen map

- winConditionLocations, is a list of locations with win conditions for a chosen map

- nonFixedLocations, is a list of non fixed locations for a chosen map

methods:

    - setInitialLocations, sets initial location, used in generate

    - setWCLocations, sets winConditionLocations, used in generate

    - setNonFixedLocations, sets nonFixedLocations, used in generate

static:

    - setMapLocations, return a list of all locations for the given map, it is used in generae, to assign all

    - utilityLocationsSearch, returns a list of locations depending on the input parameters, is is used in 
    setInitialLocations and setWCLocations to get a list of locations
