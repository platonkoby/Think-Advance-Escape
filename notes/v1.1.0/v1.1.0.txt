This version, was initialy thought of as a major update, however most of the major elements are
implemented in v1.0.1. Because plans have changed, as described below, one of the biggest features
in not implemented.


While planning to split delyed actions into 3. I realised that because there is not much
actions in total and spliting delyed into delayed and waiting is only going to reduce readability.
At this scale, this split will either increase performance only by a small bit, or even worsen the
performance.
